# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

server-of-bowen.pxl.bjth.xyz {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /var/www

	# Enable the static file server.
	file_server

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	php_fastcgi unix//run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
